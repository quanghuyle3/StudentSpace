# StudentSpace
In this project, a social media application was developed specifically for high school students to help increase interactions between them. We focused on building a strong database that supports all the simple requirements that a basic social platform needs. In the end, we deployed the database to the cloud, so students could access the application everywhere with the most updated information.
